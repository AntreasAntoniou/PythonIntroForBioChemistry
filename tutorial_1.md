## Tutorial 1: Introduction to Python and Programming

Welcome to the wonderful world of programming! üéâ This might be your first step into a larger universe and I promise you, it's going to be an exciting journey. Don't worry, we will take this step by step.

### What is Python? üêç

Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn programming language. It's widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and, of course, biochemistry!

Python is known for its clear, readable syntax, which makes it an excellent language for beginners. But don't underestimate its power ‚Äî many of the world's leading companies and research institutions use Python for their most complex tasks.

### Objective üéØ

Get your Python environment set up and run your first program!

#### Step 1: Setting up Google Colab

Google Colab is a free cloud service that supports free Python notebook environments. This will be our playground for writing and running Python code.

Navigate to Google Colab.
Sign in with your Google account. If you don't have a Google account, you'll need to create one.
Once you're signed in, you'll see a page titled "Welcome To Colaboratory". Click on "NEW NOTEBOOK" in the bottom right corner.
A new notebook will open in a new tab. This is where we'll be writing our Python code!

#### Step 2: Hello, World!

In programming tradition, the first program you write in any language is a "Hello, World!" program.

In your new Python notebook, type the following code in the cell:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Press the Shift+Enter keys to run the code. You should see Hello, World! displayed under the cell. Congratulations, you've just written and run your first Python program! ü•≥

### What's next?

Great job on completing the first tutorial! üéâ You've set up Google Colab and run your first Python program. In the next tutorial, we'll dive into Python basics and write a program related to biochemistry. How cool is that?

Remember, learning to program is like learning a new language ‚Äî practice is key. So don't forget to play around with Python and Google Colab before moving on to the next tutorial. Happy coding!
